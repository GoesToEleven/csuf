<h1>Editing {{.Title}}</h1>

<form action="/save/{{.Title}}" method="POST">
<div><textarea name="body" rows="20" cols="80">{{printf "%s" .Body}}</textarea></div>
<div><input type="submit" value="Save"></div>
</form>

<!--
Template directives are enclosed in double curly braces.
{{printf "%s" .Body}}
is a function call that outputs .Body as a string instead of a stream of bytes,
the same as a call to fmt.Printf.

The html/template package helps guarantee that only safe and correct-looking HTML
is generated by template actions. For instance, it automatically escapes any
greater than sign (>), replacing it with &gt;, to make sure user data
does not corrupt the form HTML.
